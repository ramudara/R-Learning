The following are the steps to install rstudo server on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

1) First, R must be installed on the server. This can be done using following commands.

   a) edit the file /etc/apt/sources.list to add your favorite CRAN repository 
        deb http://cran.univ-paris1.fr/bin/linux/ubuntu trusty/
      
   b) add the corresponding GPG keys to your list of keys:
        gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key E084DAB9
        gpg -a --export E084DAB9 | sudo apt-key add -
 
   c) reload the package list and install R
         sudo apt-get update
         sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev
         
   d) Packages for the CRAN repository are built on a Launchpad PPA called RutteR. It is possible to use the PPA itself, 
      which includes a few more packages than the CRAN repository. 
      
      Installing the PPA is done using:
         sudo add-apt-repository ppa:marutter/rrutter
         sudo apt-get update
      and packages can simply be installed using
         sudo apt-get install r-cran-reshape2
         
      Check R installation by typing "R" at command prompt. Output looks like as follows.
      
      ram@ram-Vostro-3546:~$ R

2) Then, install rstudio server using the below commands.
   
   The installation is performed by first installing two additional packages (the first one to ease the installation of deb packages and the second one to manage security options in RStudio Server:

    sudo apt-get install gdebi-core libapparmor1

    Then, the package is downloaded and installed using:

    wget https://download2.rstudio.org/rstudio-server-1.0.143-amd64.deb
    sudo gdebi rstudio-server-1.0.143-amd64.deb

At this step, RStudio Server is maybe accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8787.
